        <p> You hurry on to the train, thinking that this is the only chance you have to make your life interesting. After you get on the train, you sit down, but all these people, who seem to be students of some sort don't notice you. They're all chattering away excitedly and don't care about what you're doing on their train. You find your own little compartment just as the train lurches to a start. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! Youre getting on a train with a group of people you don't know about. You don't even know where the train is going either. Well, you always aspired to do something more with your life. You see a compartment of students talking excitedly.  </p>
