        <p> You decide to stay at the station and ask some questions to these strange people. You walk up to a woman peering fondly at the train. "Excuse me, who are these people?" you ask. She turns to you and looks you over. "What are you doing on this platform?" "Well... er... I just saw some people going through the brick wall, and I got curious." She gets real close and whispers, "You better forget what you've seen today and never speak of this again." She doesn't sound mean, just urgent and nervous that you'll find out about something. That makes you super curious! You think twice about getting on the train.</p>
