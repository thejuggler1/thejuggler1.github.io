        <p> Having always been a curious person, you walk over to the wall and gently touch the wall. Yup definitely solid. You try pushing a bit harder. Nothing. You heave you body as hard as you can at the wall, expecting nothing, but something unexpected happens. You fall through the wall because of you throwing yourself at it. It is as if nothing is there and you are emersed in darkness for a split second. You emerge in a train staion labeled 9 3/4. What?!? You pinch yourself. You must be dreaming. Noisy teenagers and their parents fill the steamy station. All of these people are wearing the hats and robes. Who are these people? You must find out!The train is leaving and you must decide between staying on Platform 9 3/4</p>
