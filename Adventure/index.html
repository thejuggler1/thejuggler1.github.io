        <h1>A Journey to the land of Harry Potter.</h1>
        <p>You're just a normal Englishmen living his busy life in London as what you might soon will be known as a "Muggle". Everyday you take the train from King's Cross Station to your job as a developer for "Muggle" computers. Having always been an observant person, you notice strange people in robes and pointy hats about once a year, carrying owls and other unusual things. You've always assumed these people were just crazy people who were following their own rules of society. You assumed they were going off to their annual convention. Little did you know wrong you actually were. One day, on the day of the oddballs coming to their supposed conventions, one of your coworkers who takes the same train approaches you. "Tell me Charles, do have any idea who the nutters are and what they are doing in the train station?" You reply, "No, I've been wondering the same thing!" Your coworker's cell phone rings. He pulls out his new iPhone and rushes off to answer it. As you wait on Platform 9, you see somthing interesting out of the corner of your eye. Not quite believing what you see, you turn to get a better view. Sure enough, a teenager pushing a cart containing an owl cage, a trunk, a broomstick starts running. He runs towards the birck wall dividing platform 9 and 10. Just as you're about to yell out for him to stop, he runs straight into the wall as if he's done it a million times. Not only does he NOT crash, but he continues through the brick wall like its made of water! You wipe your glasses, but remain sure of what you saw.</p>
